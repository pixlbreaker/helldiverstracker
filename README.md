## Helldivers 2 Planet Tracker App (Flutter)

This document outlines the creation of a mobile application to track planet information in Helldivers 2, built using Flutter.

**Project Setup**

1.  Create a new Flutter project using the Flutter CLI:
    ```bash
    flutter create helldivers2_planets
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd helldivers2_planets
    ```
3.  Install any required dependencies:
    * You might need additional packages for data storage or user interface elements. Research and install them using `pub`.

**Project Build**

To build the project run the following commands:

1. Clean Flutter
    ```bash
    flutter clean
    ```
2. Build the apk for release
    ```bash
    flutter build apk --release
    ```

**App Functionality**

The app will focus on keeping track of various details related to the planets in Helldivers 2. Here's a breakdown of potential features:

* **Planet Database:**
    * Create a database to store information about each planet. 
    * Include details like:
        * Planet name and designation.
        * Environment (terrain, weather conditions).
        * Enemy factions encountered.
        * Resources available for gathering.
        * Difficulty level.
* **Planet Notes (Optional):**
    * Allow users to add personal notes for each planet.
    * Document strategies or specific challenges encountered.
* **Search and Filter:**
    * Implement functionalities to search for planets based on criteria like:
        * Enemy faction.
        * Resource availability.
        * Difficulty level.

**User Interface**

* Design a user-friendly interface following Flutter's design principles.
* Consider these elements:
    * List of all planets with basic information like name, environment, and difficulty.
    * Detailed view for each planet showcasing all recorded information and notes.
    * Search and filter options to navigate the planet database efficiently.

**Additional Considerations**

*  Design the app to be responsive and function well on different screen sizes.
*  Explore integrating with Helldivers 2's API (if available) to automatically populate the planet database.

**Getting Started**

These are the initial steps. As you progress with development, you can explore adding features like images for each planet or integrating with community resources for shared planet information.

Remember to refer to the official Flutter documentation ([https://docs.flutter.dev/](https://docs.flutter.dev/)) for detailed guidance on building mobile apps using the framework.
